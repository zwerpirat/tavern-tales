A safespace for all your NPCs of your D&D campaign. Finally no NPC gets lost along the way and your players can remember their names, locations and descriptions. Yay! No more hours spent on creating new NPCs, just for your players to forget them, ignore them or try to kill them without any reason. Every NPC is important, because we are all someone else's NPC, right?
