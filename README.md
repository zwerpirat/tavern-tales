# tavern-tales

A safespace for all your NPCs of your D&D campaign. Finally no NPC gets lost along the way and your players can remember their names, locations and descriptions. Yay! No more hours spent on creating new NPCs, just for your players to forget them, ignore them or try to kill them without any reason. Every NPC is important, because we are all someone else's NPC, right? 

This app provides currently the following functions:
- Add NPCs to your NPC database
- Edit your NPC, just in case you realized you missed some important part of their backgroundstory
- Delete your NPC, if you want to get rid of them for good

Future features: 
- same functionalities for your items
- galery for all the slain monsters
- maps with locations
- counter for your next session
- integrated backgroundmusic (propably Bandcamp API)
